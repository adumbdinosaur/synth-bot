# Database Override Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
The database was being overridden when pulling new Docker images because:

1. **Hardcoded database path**: The application was hardcoded to use `app.db` in the root directory instead of respecting the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
2. **Existing database file**: There was an `app.db` file in the root directory that could potentially be copied into the Docker image
3. **Path mismatch**: Docker Compose was configured to use `./data/app.db` but the application was creating/using `./app.db`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Database Configuration
- Modified `app/database/__init__.py` to properly parse and use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Modified `app/database/manager.py` to respect the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for the default database manager
- The application now correctly uses `./data/app.db` when `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/app.db`

### 2. Fixed Docker Configuration
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to match your actual configuration (port 9999, correct image tag)
- Updated `Dockerfile` to use port 9999 by default
- Enhanced `.dockerignore` to properly exclude all database files and backups

### 3. Database File Management
- Moved the existing `app.db` file to a backup location (`app.db.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`)
- This prevents the old database from being copied into Docker images

### 4. Verification
- Created `verify_database_config.py` script to test database configuration
- Verified that the application now correctly resolves the database path to `/app/data/app.db` inside the container

## How This Fixes the Override Issue

Now when you pull a new Docker image:

1. **No database files are included in the image** - `.dockerignore` properly excludes them
2. **Database is created in the correct location** - `/app/data/app.db` inside the container
3. **Database persists via Docker volumes** - The `telegram_data` volume is mounted to `/app/data`
4. **No path conflicts** - Application and Docker Compose are aligned on the database location

## Verification Steps

1. The database will now be created at `/app/data/app.db` inside the container
2. This location is mounted to the `telegram_data` Docker volume
3. The volume persists between container restarts and image updates
4. Run the verification script: `export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./data/app.db" && python3 verify_database_config.py`

## Result
Your database will now persist correctly when pulling new Docker images and restarting containers. The database data is safely stored in the Docker volume and won't be overridden by new application code.
