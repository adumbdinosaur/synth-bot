## ðŸŽ¯ Features Working

### For Session Owners:
1. **Create Private Sessions**: Toggle privacy during Telegram connection
2. **Manage Privacy**: Toggle privacy on/off after session creation
3. **Grant Access**: Share private sessions with specific users by username
4. **Revoke Access**: Remove access from previously granted users
5. **View Access List**: See who has access to their private session

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Session Privacy Logic:
- **Public sessions**: Visible to all users (`is_private = FALSE`)
- **Private sessions**: Only visible to owner + granted users (`is_private = TRUE`)
- **Access grants**: Stored in `session_access_grants` table with owner/user relationship

### Security Features:
- Session middleware for secure temporary storage
- Username-based access granting (prevents ID guessing)
- Automatic access revocation when users are deleted
- Privacy settings preserved across reconnections

2. **Toggle privacy settings** in their dashboard
